    <h2>Swift Mining <b>CLOSED</b></h2>
    As we announced on <b>9th March 2019</b>, we will be closing our site on 15th March, but we gave more time for users to withdraw their balances. We have now finally closed the site. 
    <br><Br>
    Multiple reasons led me to the decision to close the site, including the mining rates going down every day. It dropped even further from WebMinePool but we always paid more then we get. We had no profit from this site yet! The server charges were too much. WebMinePool was bugged, they were not fixing any bugs we report over to them and instead, we were being abused for bugs from many people! 
    <br><br>We would like to thanks everyone who has been with Swift Mining since its launch and helped the site grow, reported bugs, helped other people over chat, etc.
    <br><br>
    <!-- <span style='font-size:19px;color:#fbc531;font-weight: 500;'>If you still haven't withdrawn your coins, you can do it <a href='https://beta.swiftmining.win'><b>here</b></a> until <b>30th March</b>. After which we will take down our server. </span>
    <br><Br> -->
    <h4>What's next for you?</h4>
    Here are some of our suggestions of sites you can use.
    <br><Br>
    <a href='https://firefaucet.win/?s=swiftmining' target="blank"><b>FireFaucet.win</b></a> : Our another project, which is actively being developed & updated. Although it has its own mining feature, but it is not dedicated mining site, but has lot more features.
    <br><Br>
    <a href='http://bit.ly/2VMroms' target="_blank"><b>Solo.WebMinePool.com</b></a> : A mining site owned by WebMinePool itself, not many features, manual payments -- but pays.
    <Br><Br>
    <a href='https://simpleco.in/swiftmining' target='_blank'><b>SimpleCo.in</b></a> : A nice mining site, with great features and multi coin support, you may find some of the Swift's features here and is, for now, being actively developed.
    <br><br><br>
