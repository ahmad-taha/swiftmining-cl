    <h1>Swift Mining <b>CLOSED</b></h1>
    Swift Mining and all its services are now closed. As we announced on <b>9th March 2019</b> to close the site on 31th March to give every one a chance to withdraw their balance. <BR><BR>We thanks to every user who registered on Swift Mining and built a great community.
    <br><Br>
    <!-- <span style='font-size:19px;color:#fbc531;font-weight: 500;'>If you still haven't withdrawn your coins, you can do it <a href='https://beta.swiftmining.win'><b>here</b></a> until <b>30th March</b>. After which we will take down our server. </span>
    <br><Br> -->
    <h4>What's next for you?</h4>
    Here are some of our suggestions of sites you can use.
    <br><Br>
    <a href='https://firefaucet.win/?s=swiftmining' target="blank"><b>FireFaucet.win</b></a> : Our another project, which is actively being developed & updated. Although it has its own mining feature, but it is not dedicated mining site, but has lot more features.
    <br><Br>
    <a href='http://bit.ly/2VMroms' target="_blank"><b>Solo.WebMinePool.com</b></a> : A mining site owned by WebMinePool itself, not many features, manual payments -- but pays.
    <Br><Br>
    <a href='https://simpleco.in/swiftmining' target='_blank'><b>SimpleCo.in</b></a> : A nice mining site, with great features and multi coin support, you may find some of the Swift's features here and is, for now, being actively developed.
    <br><br><br>
    If you are interested in buying this <b>domain</b> (not the script) to run your own mining or other services, then please <a href='mailto:ahmadtahaco@gmail.com'><B>contact us</B></a>!
